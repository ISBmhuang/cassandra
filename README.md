Tools for the study of the impact of network structure to the association of novel coupled environmental factors.    

1. first we generate a set of graphs. Each graph is boolean network.
2. Each graph is a Boolean network.   
3. There must be a set of signals. Each node reads or not, randomly a given signal.  
4. Define for all population which node is "reader", which one is "responder". They should be the same for the whole population.  
5. evaluate the population under a structured environment.  
6. select.  
7. repeat iterations.  
8. equilibrate to high fitness of a inputs and outputs.  
9. define a new enviroment with previous EFs but now there is a new coupled pattern.  
10. evaluate how fitness improve along time.
